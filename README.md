# zurichess: a chess engine

zurichess is a chess engine and a chess library written in [Go](http://golang).

zurichess supports [UCI protocol](http://wbec-ridderkerk.nl/html/UCIProtocol.html).


## Building

First you need to get the latest version of Go (currently 1.4).
For instructions how to download and install Go for your OS see
[documentation](https://golang.org/doc/install).

After Go 1.4 is installed, a workspace needs to be created:

```
#!bash

$ mkdir gows ; cd gows
$ export GOPATH=`pwd`
```

## Compiling

After the workspace is created downloading and compiling zurichess is easy:

```
#!bash
$ go get -u bitbucket.org/brtzsnr/zurichess/zurichess
$ $GOPATH/bin/zurichess --version
zurichess (devel), build with go1.4 at (just now), running on amd64
```

zurichess was successfully tested under Linux amd64 and Linux arm. Other people have tested zurichess under Windows amd64. Precompiled binaries for a number of platforms and architectures can be found on the [downloads](https://bitbucket.org/brtzsnr/zurichess/downloads) page.

## Perft

A [perft](https://chessprogramming.wikispaces.com/Perft) tool is included. The tool supports any starting position and can do splits up to several levels which is very helpful for debugging a move generator. You can find other positions and results [here](http://www.10x8.net/chess/PerfT.html).

```
#!bash
$ go get -u bitbucket.org/brtzsnr/zurichess/zurichess
$ $GOPATH/bin/perft --fen "rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1"
