zurichess is a chess engine and a chess library written in
[Go](http://golang). Its main goals are: to be a relatively
strong chess engine and to enable chess tools writing. See
the libray reference.

zurichess partially implements [UCI
protocol](http://wbec-ridderkerk.nl/html/UCIProtocol.html), but
the available commands are enough for most purposes.  zurichess was
successfully tested under Linux AMD64 and Linux ARM and other people
have tested zurichess under Windows AMD64.

## Build and Compile

First you need to get the latest version of Go (currently 1.4). For
instructions how to download and install Go for your OS see
[documentation](https://golang.org/doc/install). After Go 1.4 is
installed, a workspace needs to be created:

```
#!bash
$ mkdir gows ; cd gows
$ export GOPATH=`pwd`
```

After the workspace is created cloning and compiling zurichess is easy:

```
#!bash
$ go get -u bitbucket.org/brtzsnr/zurichess/zurichess
$ $GOPATH/bin/zurichess --version
zurichess (devel), build with go1.4 at (just now), running on amd64
```

## Download

Precompiled binaries for several platforms and architectures can be found
on the [downloads](https://bitbucket.org/brtzsnr/zurichess/downloads)
page.

Latest Linux AMD64 binaries can be downloaded from
[drone.io](https://drone.io/bitbucket.org/brtzsnr/zurichess/files). These
binaries should be stable for any kind of testing.


## Perft

A [perft](https://chessprogramming.wikispaces.com/Perft) tool
is included.  The tool supports any starting position and can do
splits up to several levels which is very helpful for debugging a move
generator.  You can find more positions, results and external links on the
[documentation](https://godoc.org/bitbucket.org/brtzsnr/zurichess/perft)
page.

$ go get -u bitbucket.org/brtzsnr/zurichess/perft

## Testing

[zuritest](https://bitbucket.org/brtzsnr/zuritest) is the framework used to test zurichess.

## History

### zurichess - bern (development)

* Implement Principal Variation Search.

### zurichess - basel (stable)

This release's theme is improving evaluation function.

* Speed up move ordering considerably.
* Implement null move pruning.
* Clean up and micro optimize the code.
* Tune check extensions and move ordering.
* Award mobility and add new piece square tables.
* Handle three fold repetition.
* Cache pawn structure evaluation.
* Fix transposition table bug causing a search explosion around mates.

### zurichess - appenzeller

This release's theme is improving search. ELO is about 1823 on CCRL 40/4.

* Cleaned code and improved documentation.
* Implemented aspiration window search with gradual widening.
* Improved replacement strategy in transposition table.
* Doubled the number of entries in the transposition table.
* Developed [zuritest](https://bitbucket.org/brtzsnr/zuritest), testing infrastructure for zurichess.
* Fail-softly in more situations.
* Implemented UCI commands _go movetime_ and _stop_.
* Added a separate table for principal variation.
* Added killer heuristic to improve move ordering.
* Extended search when current position is in check.
* Improved time-control. In particular zurichess uses more time when there are fewer pieces on the board.

### zurichess - aargau

This is the first public release. ELO is about 1727 on CCRL 40/4.

* Core search function is a mini-max with alpha-beta pruning on top of a negamax framework.
* Sliding attacks are implemented using fancy magic bitboards.
* Search is sped up with transposition table with Zobrist hashing.
* Move ordering inside alpha-beta is done using table move & Most Valuable Victim / Least Valuable Victim.
* Quiescence search is used to reduce search instability and horizon effect.
* [Simplified evaluation function](https://chessprogramming.wikispaces.com/Simplified+evaluation+function) with tapered eval.
